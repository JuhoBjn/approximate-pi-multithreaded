# approximate-pi-threads
Approximate the value of pi using a random number generator. This time utilizing threads.

I first saw this problem in a YouTube video by Joma Tech. I found it quite interesting and coded along to his solution using C++.
Now, half a year later I decided to try and make a multi-threaded version of it. :D
